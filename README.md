This repository contains python progams that make use of user-defined functions.

Task 1: a function that sums all elements in a list.
The for loop is used, adding the current number to the running total until all the elements of the list are addded.


Task 2: Check if a number is odd or even
The modulus operator, % , checks whether a given number is even or odd.
If the number divided by 2 gives a remainder of 0, it is even; otherwise, it is odd.


Task 3: Find factorial using a loop
The for loop is used in this task. 
It multiplies numbers from 1 up to n to get the result.
Moreover, it checks if the number is negative or zero


Task 4: Reverse a string without using slicing or built-in functions
The program reverses a string manually using a for loop, reversing character by character


Task 5: Find factorial using recursion
The function defined calls itself repeatedly, each time with a smaller number, until it reaches 1.


Task 6: Sum of the digits of a number
The while loop is used.
It extracts each digit using the modulus, adds it to a running total, and removes the digit using the integer division
